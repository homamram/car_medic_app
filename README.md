The "Vehicle Maintenance and Parking Management" application is a digital platform crafted to streamline and enhance the operations of parking cars and maintenance services.
Leveraging modern interfaces and fundamental technologies, it ensures a robust foundation for an effective user base. 
The application is structured into two primary sections: the (User) interface for vehicle owners and the (Admin) dashboard for service providers, each designed to deliver a seamless and efficient experience.
